        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p><span style="color:green;">Hello everyone! My name is Ido Isaac</span> <em>(pronounced like "Ee-do")</em> I am 30 years old from Israel. This is my first semester at <strong>Centennial College</strong>, I am enrolled in the <strong>Game Programming course</strong>.<br>
        I am very exceited to begin my studies, although maybe a little cold, my home country is very warm <i>(alot of it is desert)</i> but like our former prime minister said we are <blockquote><b>"Making the Desert Bloom"</b></blockquote><br>
        <span style="color:orange;">I've been in Canada for about a month</span> <i>(as I'm writing this)</i> and I absolutely love it, it is a magnificent country. Even in winter I love nature, hiking and trecking, and the parks here are charming, quiet and relaxing.</p>

            <h3>Early Life:</h3>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(91, 179, 251);">I was born in Ramat Gan, Israel</span>, though I lived most of my life in <b>Rosh Haayin</b>. In highschool I majored in art and graphic design, I enjoy drawing more than I do painting.<br>
                After highschool I joined the <u>IDF</u>, Israels military to serve my mandatory 3 years, there I was a combatant in <u>field intelligence</u> and later a squad leader.<br>
                When I finished my army service I studied graphic design at a public college and worked as a <strong>freelance graphic designer, making posters, fliers and banners.</strong><br>
                I also worked in several customer service jobs including at a <em>duty free store</em> and an <i>office supplies shop.</i></p>
